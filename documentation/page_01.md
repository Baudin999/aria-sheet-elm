# Why I started to learn Elm

Back in the day I used to be a C# developer writing big Enterprise applications. Big enterprise applications seem to come with their own set of ideas and rules. I've done almost everything, from CQRS, Micro Services to "Just do it" applications. I've build application in a more functional style and with _good_ OOP designs but I've never found it interresting.

That is when I discovered User Interfaces! User Interfaces are difficult to build, the results are exciting and the best part is that you get to write JavaScript! JavaScript lets you write everything you want in a truly minimalistic set of language rules and it still manages to perform quite well!

The downside of writing JavaScript is that maintaining an old application is really hard. You practically need to have written the code yourself and you need to be able to _think_ the way you _thought_ when writing that original code. I wanted something more. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) led me down the same path as C# and I truly dislike OOP and the mess it results in. I've tries [Fable](http://fable.io/), [PureScript](http://www.purescript.org/), [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) and many other languages untill I reached [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/).

Elm is easy enough to get started with, easy to set up but really hard to master. And this brings me to why I'm writing these tutorials. If you are like me and want to get started with Elm but want to do it in such a way that you can write big enterprisy applications you will slam agains brick walls. My hope is that these tutorials will help you pass through those walls more quickly.


# Intalling Elm

I'm not going to write anything on installing Elm. There are plenty of tutorials on how to do that. What I _am_ going to do is write on my setup and the tools I use to work with Elm. 

I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). I'm not hapy with it, but it beats the other options out there.
